[Verse 1]
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young, dumb, young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da
Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Young, dumb, broke high school kids

[Verse 2]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young, dumb, young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, young, young, dumb and broke

Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da
Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Young, dumb, broke high school kids

[Bridge]
Jump and we think, "Leave it all in the game of love, love"
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun, fun
Woah-oh-oh
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young, dumb, young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da
Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da
Ya-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
