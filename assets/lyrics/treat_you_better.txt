[Intro]
JRoa
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

[Verse 2]
Ilang beses mo nang sinabi sa'kin na masaya ka
Sa piling niya pero bakit umiiyak ka pa?
Akala mo ba na 'di ko alam ako'y mahal mo pa?
Pеro bakit mas pinili mo na magpakatanga sa kaniya?
Nandito lang naman ako naghihintay
Na muli ang pag-ibig mo sa'ki'y ibigay
Pangako na aalagaan kita, hindi ka na muling luluha pa

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than hе can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

[Bridge]
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
[Outro]
I know I can treat you better than he can (Better than he can)
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman (Better than he can)
I know I can treat you better, better than he can
I know I can treat you better, better than he can
